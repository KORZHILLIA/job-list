# React homework template

This project's been powered by React homework template that was used for
homeworks in GoIT School
(https://github.com/goitacademy/react-homework-template).

## Features

1. This project is completely own. Other contributors are shown by default.
2. Entire jobs list is loaded at once but results are shown restricted
   intentionally as pagination mechanics was performed.
3. The implementation was thoroughly including some strange detailes as cutted
   image in JobDetailed mobile version.
4. The absence of custom marker on map, presence of excessive elements and
   unknown zoom value are unknown and will be researched.
5. As Tailwind framework is unstudied, all the styles were done by native css,
   but please don't doubt of ability to use scss as well as to learn framework
   mentioned.
6. 'id' prop of PersonalActivity component was added for possible extending of
   current project.
7. Unaccordance of Save to my list icon in JobDetailed mobile version is
   explained by the malfunction of original icon.
8. Pagination logics is totally personal, so maybe it has lack, but it works
   correctly.
9. Pagination arrows that are absent in mobile version model were added
   intentionally.
10. New way of new component creation process was invented (createComponent.js).

## Thanx for your attention and I hope of further communications.
